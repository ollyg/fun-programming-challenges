\section{Foreword}

\paragraph{} This book aims to provide a set of problems, suitable for
assisting learning any language that has a graphical library available to it.
It's deliberately not language specific however your language should be able
to cope with objects.

\paragraph{} Each chapter has a common theme or scenario that is present in
all tasks for that chapter. Inside each chapter the tasks start off at what is
hoped to be a reasonable level and then have increasing difficulty with task
number. If learning programming for the first time you'll do best if you can
identify a mentor to help give advice with background subjects that tasks
cover (for instance event driven programming in GUI design). It might be
possible to use the tasks as part of a taught course.

\paragraph{} I originally wrote this to help myself improve my programming by
having tasks to solve. Any feedback such as on perceived missing steps or task
difficulty jumps is welcome at guyjohnedwards@gmail.com
